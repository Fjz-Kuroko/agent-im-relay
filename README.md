## Why Agent Inbox

- **Inbox-first workflow** - Send a message to the bot in your IM app, let the agent open a session automatically, execute the task, and send the result back with file upload and download support.
- **Multiple IM platforms** - Discord, Feishu, and Slack are supported today, and the architecture is designed to extend cleanly to additional platforms.
- **Multiple agent backends** - Switch between Claude Code and OpenAI Codex depending on the task.
- **Runs locally with full data control** - Configuration and runtime state live in `~/.agent-inbox/`, with no cloud deployment required.
- **Persistent sessions** - Keep context across messages, interrupt and resume work, and isolate each session in its own working directory.
- **Safe-mode approvals in IM** - When enabled, dangerous backend actions are surfaced as approval cards/buttons in your chat.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install

```bash
npm install -g @doctorwu/agent-inbox
# Or run it directly without a global install
npx @doctorwu/agent-inbox
```

### Step 2: Configure

On first launch, Agent Inbox starts an interactive setup wizard that walks you through IM platform configuration. Backend/model selection is done per conversation through platform controls.

Configuration is stored in `~/.agent-inbox/config.jsonl`. Example:

```jsonc
{"type":"meta","version":1}
{"type":"im","id":"discord","enabled":true,"config":{"token":"your-bot-token","clientId":"your-client-id"}}
{"type":"im","id":"feishu","enabled":false,"config":{"appId":"","appSecret":""}}
{"type":"im","id":"slack","enabled":false,"config":{"botToken":"","appToken":"","signingSecret":"","socketMode":true}}
{"type":"runtime","config":{"agentTimeoutMs":600000,"permissionMode":"auto","permissionRequestTimeoutMs":120000,"claudeBin":"claude","codexBin":"codex","opencodeBin":"opencode"}}
```

Standalone adapter runs use the same `~/.agent-inbox/config.jsonl` file. There is no repo-local `.env` bootstrap path.

### Step 3: Start

```bash
agent-inbox
```

After startup, send a message to your configured bot to begin interacting with the agent.
Only one running instance is allowed per platform on the same machine.

## Supported IM Platforms

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|------|------|------|
| **Discord** ⭐ Recommended | ✅ Supported | Slash commands + mention-driven thread sessions, attachment ingest and artifact upload, streaming output |
| **Feishu (Lark)** | ✅ Supported | Long-connection mode, private-chat launcher, session/group chat continuation, interactive control cards |
| **Slack** | ✅ Supported | Slash commands + app mentions + DM/thread continuation, backend/model selection blocks, safe-mode approval blocks |

## Platform Features

| Platform | How to start a run | Session controls | Files |
|------|------|------|------|
| **Discord** | `/code`, `/ask`, `/skill`, or `@mention` | `/interrupt`, `/done`, `/model`, `/effort`, `/sessions`, `/cwd`, `/compact`; backend/model selection cards on first run | Slash commands accept attachment options (up to 3) and mention messages ingest message attachments; outgoing artifacts are uploaded back |
| **Feishu** | Send a message in session/group chat, or use private chat launcher; `/ask <prompt>` for ask mode | Interactive cards for interrupt/backend/model/effort/done, plus backend switch confirmation | Message files are ingested and usable in run context; generated files can be uploaded back |
| **Slack** | `/code`, `/ask`, `/skill`, app mention, DM message, or thread reply | `/interrupt`, `/done`; backend/model picked via Block Kit buttons; safe-mode approval buttons | Text-first workflow (no built-in Slack file ingest/upload pipeline yet) |

### Discord Setup

Create a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and obtain its `Token` and `Client ID`.

Discord is the recommended platform for the best interactive workflow. It supports:

- `/code <prompt>` — Start a coding task and automatically create a dedicated thread for the session
- `/ask <question>` — Ask a quick question without file tools
- `/skill <name> <prompt>` — Invoke a predefined skill directly
- `/model <name>` — Switch the active agent model
- `/effort <level>` — Set the agent effort level
- `/sessions` — List active sessions
- `/cwd set|show|clear` — Manage thread-level working directory override
- `/compact` — Ask the agent to summarize current thread context
- `/interrupt` — Interrupt the current task
- `/done` — End the current session
- `@mention` — Mention the bot in a channel to trigger a conversation there as well

### Feishu Setup

Create a self-built enterprise application in the [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn), enable long-connection event subscriptions, and obtain the `App ID` and `App Secret`.

### Slack Setup

Create a Slack app with slash commands and Socket Mode, then collect `botToken`, `appToken`, and `signingSecret`.

## Inline Backend Control Tag

In mention/message flows, you can switch backend inline by embedding:

```text
<set-backend>codex</set-backend>
Please continue this task.
```

The tag is removed before sending prompt text to the backend. If multiple valid tags are present, the last one wins.

---

## Supported Agent Backends

| Backend | Notes |
|---------|------|
| **Claude Code** | Anthropic Claude with streaming output and tool calling |
| **OpenAI Codex** | OpenAI Codex CLI with streaming output |
| **OpenCode** | Optional fallback backend with no known safe-mode approval protocol |

You can switch backend/model per conversation through platform controls (Discord commands/cards, Feishu cards, Slack buttons), and via inline `<set-backend>...</set-backend>` tags in message flows.

---

## Permission Mode

Permission approval behavior is configured in the `runtime` record inside `~/.agent-inbox/config.jsonl`.

### `permissionMode`

- `auto` - Backward-compatible default behavior. Agent backends run with their existing automation flags, so dangerous operations are handled automatically with no IM approval step.
- `safe` - Dangerous operations require an explicit approval from the IM client before the backend continues. Agent Inbox sends an approval card into the active conversation, waits for a user decision, then writes the backend's real approval protocol response back to stdin.

Safe mode currently requires backend CLIs with these capabilities:

- Codex must support `codex app-server --listen stdio://`
- Claude Code must support bidirectional `--input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json`
- OpenCode does not currently expose an equivalent approval protocol, so safe mode degrades to the backend's normal behavior or an unsupported-mode warning

### `permissionRequestTimeoutMs`

- Timeout in milliseconds for each pending permission request.
- Default: `120000` (2 minutes).
- Applies only when `permissionMode` is `safe`.

Example:

```jsonc
{"type":"runtime","config":{"permissionMode":"safe","permissionRequestTimeoutMs":120000}}
```

### Safe-Mode User Flow

1. The backend encounters a dangerous action and emits a permission request.
2. Agent Inbox renders an approval card in the active Discord thread, Feishu session chat, or Slack thread / DM.
3. A user clicks `Approve` or `Deny`.
4. Agent Inbox writes the backend-specific approval response back to stdin and the run continues.
5. If no one responds before timeout, the request is denied automatically and the backend continues by skipping that action.

### Platform Card Styles

- Discord - A thread message with `Permission required`, optional tool / reason text, and `Approve` / `Deny` buttons. After a decision, the message is updated with the final status.
- Feishu - An interactive card with a `Permission Required` header, tool / reason details, and `Approve` / `Deny` buttons. After resolution, the card shows the final status.
- Slack - A Block Kit card with a `Permission Required` summary, tool / reason section, and `Approve` / `Deny` buttons. After resolution, the same card is updated with the final status.

### Timeout Behavior

- Timeout defaults to `deny`.
- The backend keeps running after timeout and should skip the blocked operation instead of hanging indefinitely.
- The rendered card status changes to indicate that the request timed out and was denied.
